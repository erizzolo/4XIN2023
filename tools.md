# Suggested Programming tools
At the beginning, just any Java Development kit and any Text editor will do.

Then, I suggest that you install the same version of Netbeans that you will be using at school.

Here the examples are with Visual Studio Code: you will find a *src* folder that should be importable without problems into a Netbeans project or a BlueJ project or similar...

> Example Java projects have an introductory README.md file (sometimes **very** useful!).
