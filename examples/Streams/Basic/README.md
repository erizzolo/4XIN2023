## Basic stream usage

Examples of basic usage of (raw) streams.

A simple app with four "main" methods:

*        tryWithBlock
*        tryWithOutBlock
*        tryWithSingle
*        tryWithOutSingle

The differences are about:
* syntax: *try with resources* or ~~old~~ *try catch finally* construct
* elaboration by *single* byte or by *block* of bytes in methods *single* or *block*
